10. **Footer Social Media Links:**
    *   Line 213: Replace `href="#"` for Facebook with your actual Facebook profile URL.
    *   Line 214: Replace `href="#"` for Instagram with your actual Instagram profile URL.

**In `index.css`:**

1.  **Client Logo Scroller Animation & Dimensions (Advanced Customization):**
    *   The `.client-logo img` class (around line 410) has `height: 80px;` and `max-width: 200px;`.
    *   The `.logo-scroller-inner` class (around line 397) has its `width` and `animation` (`@keyframes scrollLogos`) calculated using CSS variables `--client-logo-width` and `--client-logo-gap`. These variables are defined in `:root` and overridden in media queries to adjust the scroller's behavior.
        *   Default: `--client-logo-width: 180px;`, `--client-logo-gap: 4rem;`
        *   Animation duration is set to `30s`. You can change this value in `.logo-scroller-inner { animation: scrollLogos 30s linear infinite; }`.
    *   If you change the number of unique logos from 5, you'll need to update the `5` multiplier in the `width` and `transform` calculations within `.logo-scroller-inner` and `@keyframes scrollLogos`.

**In `index.tsx`:**

1.  **Translations:**
    *   The copyright year in `footerCopyright` has been updated to 2025.
    *   The `serviceWebPageTitle` and `serviceWebPageDesc` keys have been updated for the "Web Page or App" service.
    *   New translation keys `serviceAuthAgentTitle` and `serviceAuthAgentDesc` have been added for the "AI Authorization Agent" service.
    *   A new translation key `profileImageAlt` has been added for the "About Me" profile picture.
    *   New translation keys `hotelDelSolarLogoAlt`, `lanzaLaBolaLogoAlt`, and `pehuajo365LogoAlt` have been added for the new client logos.
    *   Ensure all other translations match your desired content.

2.  **Liquid Glass Effect (Client Section Background):**
    *   A new function `initLiquidGlassEffect()` has been added to create an animated background for the client logos section. This is a visual enhancement and does not have direct user-configurable placeholders beyond its code.

**General:**

*   **Favicon:** The current favicon is an inline SVG emoji. You might want to replace this with your own custom favicon by linking it in the `<head>` of `index.html`.
*   **Keywords & Descriptions:** Review all meta descriptions and keywords in `index.html` (lines 7-8, 12, 19) and update them to accurately reflect your profile and services if they differ from the template.
*   **Language Content:** If you modify the structure or add new text elements that need translation, remember to update the `translations` object in `index.tsx` and add the appropriate `data-translate-key` or `data-translate-key-alt` attributes to your HTML.
